    <h1>Welcome to Martin's Aquarium!</h1>
    <p>Within this page, you'll find tons of information on the
        various fish that Martin has harvested over the years, as well as some helpful
        hints for those of you that may want to start a collection of your own!

        <h2>Martin's Fish</h2>
        <p>Below you'll find a detailed look at the types of fish Martin has collected
            as well as a hefty amount of information regarding each fish!
            <aside>
                <p>Did you know? Whenever you acclimate a new specimen, some salt water is necessarily removed from your
                    system.
                    If you forget about this and later top off the tank with fresh water, you will end up lowering the
                    salinity in the process, if only to a small degree. </p>
                <p>The best way to keep an aquarium clean is with a proper filter for the tank's type and size.
                    Opt for the best quality filter that fits in your budget, ideally one that uses mechanical, biological
                    and chemical filtration for the best combination of cleaning.
                    Check the filter periodically to be sure it is operating correctly, and keep it clean to maximize its
                    efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>A little elbow grease is essential to keep your aquarium at its cleanest. Use a scraper to remove excess
                    algae from the glass, and vacuum the gravel when debris accumulates.
                    Trim away dead leaves from aquatic plants, and wipe algae off props and decorations.
                    A little work will make a big difference in your aquarium's appearance.
                </p>
                <p>If you have an external filter, cooling your aquarium is a little easier. Running the tubes through
                    colder water or even an ice box can really help, but you have to keep a close eye on everything.
                    The temperature can not drop too quickly, as this can damage both the fish and your precious cycle. This
                    is a method you may want to skip with smaller aquariums!
